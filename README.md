tnetstring3: superfast data serialization for python3
=====================================================

This is the excelent [tnetstring](http://github.com/rfk/tnetstring) python 
package ported to Python3.

In order to avoid pitfalls in encode/decoding of strings the original support
for encoding was removed. Now, only bytes are allowed as string.

To install using pip, just issue:
    
    pip3 install tnetstring3
